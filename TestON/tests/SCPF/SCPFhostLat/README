Host LATENCY

Summary: This is a performance test suite to measure the time it takes ONOS
        to recognize a host going up and down.

Pre-requisites: To run out-of-the box this test requires 7 NODES.
    OC1->OC7 must be set before initiating the test. Passwordless login
    must be set from TestStation "sdn" root user. The 7 NODES must have
    their clocks synced to TestStation via ptpd and be accurate to the
    millisecond. You will also need the Wireshark disector to see openflow packets.

NOTE: Only scale sizes 1,3,5 and 7 will be functional
