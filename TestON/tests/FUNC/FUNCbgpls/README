ONOS BGPLS Feature Scripts
***************************

Brief :
*******
        BGPLS as a southbound plug-in in ONOS controller to collect the
        topology information of the network. This network topology can be
        used by some applications like PCE would benefit from visibility
        outside one area or Autonomous System (AS) in order to make better
        decisions for path computation.


Prerequisites:

Things to know :
****************

1] We use Scapy tool, to send the BGPLS packet to ONOS.
2] The packets are already pre-captured.
3] ONOS reads those packet and displays the topology.
4] We query the devices information in ONOS to check the devices/links are learn
